# Tweet Analyzer

**Rastal's Project 0**

*Reads tweets from a file (each line in the file containing a single tweet) and prints up to 100 of the most frequently occurring words to the command line.*

### Compile

`sbt compile`

### Test

`sbt test`

### Run

The analyzer takes a single argument with `run`, an integer for limiting the number of results to display (up to a maximum of 100). If no argument is passed in, it defaults to 100.

`sbt "run [maxResults]"`
